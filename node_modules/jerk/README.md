# Jerk

A fun little IRC bot library for node.js. Ridiculously simple to set-up and get going!

## OHMYGOD

Seriously, it's stupidly simple.

### Your First Bot

Firstly, we'll need to grab Jerk. If you use [npm](http://npmjs.org/) it's as easy as:

    npm install jerk

If you prefer straight-up git:

    git clone git://github.com/gf3/Jerk.git

Hoo haa, now that we're locked and loaded, let's write a goddamn bot! We need to include Jerk:

    var jerk = require( 'jerk' )

You'll need some `options`. Jerk takes the exact same options object as the [IRC-js library](https://github.com/gf3/IRC-js/). Let's just go ahead and supply some basic info:

    var options =
      { server: 'irc.freenode.net'
      , nick: 'YourBot9001'
      , channels: [ '#your-channel' ]
      }

Hah, now you're going to cry once you see how easy this is:

    jerk( function( j ) {

      j.watch_for( 'soup', function( message ) {
        message.say( message.user + ': soup is good food!' )
      })

      j.watch_for( /^(.+) are silly$/, function( message ) {
        message.say( message.user + ': ' + message.match_data[1] + ' are NOT SILLY. Don't joke!' )
      })

    }).connect( options )

Really. That's it.

### ADVANCED USER OF THE INTERNETS

The jerk object (`j`) has only one method: `watch_for`. Which takes two arguments, the first can be either a string or a regex to match messages against. The second argument is your hollaback function for when a match is found. The hollaback receives only one argument, the `message` object. It looks like this:

    { user:       String
    , source:     String
    , match_data: Array
    , say:        Function( message )
    }

One thing I will tell you though, is the `say` method is smart enough to reply to the context that the message was received, so you don't need to pass it any extra info, just a reply :)

The `connect` method returns an object with some handy methods that you can use outside of your `watch_for`s:

    { say:    Function( destination, message )
    , action: Function( destination, action )
    , part:   Function( channel )
    , join:   Function( channel )
    , quit:   Function( message )
    }

Example:

    var superBot = jerk( ... ).connect( options )
    // Later...
    superBot.say( '#myChan', 'Soup noobs?' )
    superBot.join( '#haters' )
    superBot.action( '#hates', 'hates all of you!' )

I think everything there is pretty self-explanatory, no? 

### Running Your Bot

    node yourBot9001.js

Run your bot on a remote server:

    nohup node yourBot9001.js &

Although I recommend using something like [forever](https://github.com/indexzero/forever) to keep your bot running for a while.

Done.

### A Better Example

Here's a more practical example, meet [protobot](https://github.com/gf3/protobot/blob/master/protobot.js). Protobot hangs out on [Freenode#prototype](irc://irc.freenode.net/prototype) all day &ndash; stop by and say hi!

A few bots using Jerk:

* [Protobot](https://github.com/gf3/protobot)
* [csbot](https://github.com/rdrake/csbot)
* [Codebot](https://github.com/BHSPitMonkey/Codebot)
* Crockbot
